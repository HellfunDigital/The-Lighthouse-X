1. "os" module: This module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. All three files will need this to interact with the file system.

2. "subprocess" module: This module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. This will be used in all files for running system commands.

3. "logging" module: This module is used to record (log) events. All three files will need this to log the debugging and cleanup process.

4. "git" module: This module is used to interact with Git repositories. Both "debugger.py" and "cleanup.py" will need this to interact with the repo.

5. "json" module: This module is used to work with JSON data. If there are any configurations or data stored in JSON format, all three files will need this.

6. "debug" function: This function will be defined in "debugger.py" and used in "main.py" to start the debugging process.

7. "cleanup" function: This function will be defined in "cleanup.py" and used in "main.py" to start the cleanup process.

8. "main" function: This function will be defined in "main.py" and will use both "debug" and "cleanup" functions to debug and clean up the repo directory.

9. "REPO_PATH" variable: This global variable will hold the path to the repo directory. It will be used in all three files.

10. "LOG_FILE" variable: This global variable will hold the path to the log file. It will be used in all three files.

11. "CONFIG_FILE" variable: This global variable will hold the path to the configuration file. It will be used in all three files.

Please note that the actual shared dependencies might vary based on the specific requirements and implementation details of the program.
