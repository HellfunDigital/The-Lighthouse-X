1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: All three files (index.html, style.css, main.js) share a common dependency on the DOM structure. The HTML file defines the structure, the CSS file styles it, and the JavaScript file manipulates it.

2. DOM Element IDs: These are shared between the HTML and JavaScript files. For example, the JavaScript file may use getElementById to manipulate a specific element defined in the HTML file.

3. CSS Classes: These are shared between the HTML and CSS files. The HTML file assigns classes to elements, and the CSS file defines styles for these classes.

4. Media Files: The img, audio, and video directories may contain media files that are referenced in the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.

5. Exported Variables: These are shared between different JavaScript files. If main.js exports a variable, it can be imported and used in another JavaScript file.

6. Data Schemas: If the website uses a database, the data schemas would be shared across all files that interact with the database.

7. Function Names: If functions are defined in one JavaScript file and used in another, the function names are a shared dependency.

8. Message Names: If the website uses a messaging system (like WebSocket or postMessage), the message names would be a shared dependency.

9. README.md: This file doesn't share dependencies with the code, but it should include information about all dependencies used in the project, as well as instructions for setting up and running the project.
