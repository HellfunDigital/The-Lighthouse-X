# The Lighthouse ARG

The Lighthouse is an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) website that chronicles the disappearance of Warden Ilya Moreau and the strange silence surrounding the lighthouse beam. The experience blends interactive puzzles, encoded transmissions, and hidden pages that gradually reveal the truth about the Undertow Collective.

## Experience overview

1. **Signal archive** &mdash; Decode Caesar-shifted transmissions to recover Moreau's warnings.
2. **Logbook terminal** &mdash; Use the recovered rhythm to unlock access to the lantern room.
3. **Lantern Room** &mdash; Align constellations and decipher Moreau's diary emphasis.
4. **Underdeck** &mdash; Tune resonance levers to unseal the vault and learn of the archivist.
5. **Northlight** &mdash; Follow the hidden archivist for the final encoded instructions.

Lore fragments, spectral notes, and CSS comments hide additional hints for players who dig deeper.
